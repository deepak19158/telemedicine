# CLAUDE.md - Telemedicine Platform Development Guide

## Project Overview

This is a **web-based telemedicine platform** that enables patients to consult with doctors online while incorporating an agent referral system. The platform serves three primary user roles: **Patients**, **Doctors**, and **Agents**.

### Core Business Model
- Patients book online medical consultations
- Agents refer patients using discount codes and earn commissions
- Doctors manage appointments and provide consultations
- Multi-role authentication and dashboards for each user type

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14+** with App Router (primary framework)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Hook Form** for form handling
- **Zustand** or React Context for state management
- **NextAuth.js** for authentication

### Backend
- **Express.js** (Node.js) for API server
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM
- **NextAuth.js** integration for JWT tokens
- **Multer** for file uploads
- **NodeMailer** for email services

### Payments & Services
- **Razorpay** and **PayU** for online payments
- Cash payments via agents
- **Redis** for caching (optional)

## Architecture Pattern

### Hybrid Architecture
- **Next.js** handles frontend, authentication, and some API routes
- **Express.js** serves as the main API backend
- **MongoDB** for data persistence
- **NextAuth.js** bridges authentication between frontend and backend

## Code Review Process

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

### Review Criteria
- **Functionality**: Does the code work as expected?
- **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand?
- **Maintainability**: Can the code be easily modified?
- **Performance**: Does it meet performance requirements?
- **Security**: Are security best practices followed?

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: Continuous Integration
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e
```

### Test Coverage Goals
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests: Critical paths covered
- E2E tests: Main user workflows
- Performance tests: Response time benchmarks

## Dependency Management

### Security Updates
- Weekly dependency security scans
- Automated vulnerability alerts
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch prioritization

### Version Management
- Semantic versioning for releases
- Dependency pinning for stability
- Regular major version updates
- Breaking change documentation

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracking
- Page load times
- API response times
- Database query performance
- User interaction metrics
- Error rates and patterns

### Alerts & Notifications
- Performance degradation alerts
- Error rate threshold alerts
- Uptime monitoring
- Resource utilization alerts

## Bug Tracking Process

### Issue Classification
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss
- **High**: Feature blocking, major functionality broken
- **Medium**: Minor feature issues, performance problems
- **Low**: UI inconsistencies, minor enhancements

### Resolution Workflow
1. Issue reported and triaged
2. Priority assignment
3. Developer assignment
4. Fix implementation
5. Testing and verification
6. Deployment and monitoring

## User Feedback Integration

### Feedback Channels
- In-app feedback forms
- User support tickets
- Analytics and usage data
- User interviews and surveys

### Feedback Processing
- Regular feedback review sessions
- Feature request prioritization
- Bug report validation
- User experience improvements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage maintained
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production
- [ ] Weekly security updates applied
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] User satisfaction > 4/5 stars

## Notes
Maintain consistent quality standards throughout the development lifecycle.
